Damage Variance Slider - Customize the percentage that damage randomly changes by

By default, your damage varies by +-15%. With this mod, you can set it up to 100% or disable it entirely! This is done by using the slider in the config of this mod.
An additional setting to disable luck based skewing also exists if needed.

Notes:
* Affects player-to-enemy damage only
* Serversided config
* Useful for developers that test/balance mods

Disclaimer:
Such a feature exists in other mods already, I wanted to have a standalone version of this that includes nothing else; Do check out these mods though, you may like them aswell:
