By default, your damage varies by +-15%. With this mod, you can set it up to 100% or disable it entirely! This is done by using the slider in the config of this mod.

An additional setting to disable luck based skewing also exists if needed.

**Notes:**
* Affects player-to-enemy damage only
* Serversided config
* Useful for developers that test/balance mods
